# Novel-Cpu-Scheduler-Algo


## Overview

The Hybrid Scheduling Algorithm is a process scheduling approach designed to optimize CPU utilization and performance by combining features from multiple scheduling algorithms. It aims to balance the advantages of different scheduling methods, providing a more efficient and fair distribution of CPU resources among processes.

### Key Features

- **Combines Multiple Algorithms**: Integrates elements from various scheduling strategies (e.g., First-Come-First-Serve, Shortest Job Next, Round Robin) to leverage their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses.
- **Improved Performance**: Optimizes CPU utilization and process throughput by dynamically adjusting scheduling decisions based on current system state.
- **Fair Resource Allocation**: Ensures a balanced distribution of CPU time among processes, reducing the likelihood of starvation and improving response times.

### How It Works

1. **Process Classification**: The algorithm categorizes incoming processes based on criteria such as burst time, priority, and arrival time.
2. **Dynamic Scheduling**: It dynamically selects the most appropriate scheduling strategy for the current set of processes, adjusting in real-time to changing conditions.
3. **Performance Metrics**: The algorithm tracks various performance metrics (e.g., average wait time, turnaround time) to continually optimize its scheduling decisions.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Efficiency**: By combining the strengths of multiple algorithms, the hybrid approach achieves better overall system performance.
- **Flexibility**: The algorithm adapts to different types of workloads, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **Reduced Starvation**: Fair allocation policies help prevent certain processes from being perpetually delayed, ensuring a more equitable distribution of resources.

## Conclusion

The Hybrid Scheduling Algorithm represents a versatile and effective approach to process scheduling, addressing the limitations of traditional algorithms through a dynamic and adaptive framework. It offers significant improvements in CPU utilization, process throughput, and fairness, making it a valuable solution for modern computing environments.
